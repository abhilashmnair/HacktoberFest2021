This repository is made for beginners who are unfamiliar with open source and GitHub. So what is holding you back?! Make your first contribution to the open source and take home swags. :tshirt::package:
<br>

## <b>What is Hacktober Fest?</b>

Hacktoberfest is a month-long open source contribution program hosted by DigitalOcean in the month of October for supporting open source development. Hacktoberfest encourages participation in the open source community, which grows bigger every year. Whether you are a pro in programming or a newbie, Hacktoberfest welcomes each one of the contributors for providing their valuable contribution to the open source community. Completing the challenge earns you a limited edition swags and other exiciting goodies.
<br>

## <b>How to receive swags?</b>
- Register yourself at the [Hacktober Fest Website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)
- Create 4 pull-requests from repositories participating in the challenge (repositories having `hacktoberfest` topic)
- Successfully merged PRs will be validated further for 14 days.
- After that, the PR is accepted
- Remember! All PRs must be done between October 1 to October 31 to be eligible for swags.
- This year the first 55,000 participants will be eligible for the prize.<br>

## <b>How to contribute?</b>
Read [`RULES.md`](https://github.com/abhilashmnair/HacktoberFest2021/blob/main/RULES.md) before creating a pull request
- Star (would mean a lot!) and clone the repository. You can use the Github CLI or GitHub Desktop Client to clone the repo.
- Add your file containing a useful code and create a pull request.
- Wait for your pull-request to be verified by the maintainer and merged into the branch.

Not a developer or programmer? Don't worry! Add useful documentation and fix grammatical errors in the `README` file. Every single contribution of yours will benefit your open source venture.<br>

**PRs violating the rules will be closed and reported *Spam*! :x:**
<br>

## <b>How to fork and create a PR?</b>
- When you want to work on a GitHub project, the first step is to fork a repo.
- First, you need to open the repo that you want to contribute to, and then simply click on `Fork` button in the top-right corner. This creates a new copy of that repo under your GitHub user account with a URL like:
```
https://github.com/<YourUserName>/<repo name>
```
- Next, clone the repo by opening the terminal on your computer and running the command:
```
git clone https://github.com/<YourUserName>/<repo name>
```
- Once the repo is cloned, you need to do one thing:
- Create a new branch by issuing the command:
```
git checkout -b new_branch
```
- Now you can make changes to the code and once you're done with the changes, push it by first committing the changes using:
```
git commit -S -m <Your Message in quotes>
```
- and then:
```
git push -u origin new_branch
```
- Once you push the changes to your repo, the `Compare & pull request` button will appear in GitHub. Click it and then you'll be taken to a screen where you can open a pull request by clicking the `Create pull request` button. 
- This allows the repo's maintainers to review your contribution. From here, they can merge it if it is good, or they may ask you to make some changes.
